# Chapter 15: Using Native Features

## Why use Native Features

Before determining that you need to use Native Features, you should search for an existing library handing it. For example Plugin-X, which is covered in Chapter 11.

If what you need to do isn't covered (for example, using a BlueTooth accessory), you'll have to dig in and do the C++ wrappers yourself.

In this chapter, we are going to see how we can open an URL, to be able to redirect the user to our website, or any other website, on iOS and Android.

## C++ Interface
The first step is to determine how the C++ code should call the Native Feature.
We want to open an URL, and have a boolean as a result to know if the OS failed to open that URL.

Here is the code to add in your header, which should be in your Classes/ folder so that it's visible by all platforms. Let's call it MailWrapper.h

```cpp
bool openUrl(std::string url)
```

Now we need to implement this function on each platform. The implementation will be different since it will call Objective-C and Java code.

## iOS Implementation
Now for the iOS Implementation, it's rather straigthforward.
First, you create your .mm file. Why .mm, and not .cpp or .m? 

* .cpp, as you are already aware, identifies C++ code. You can't add Objective-C here, meaning you don't have access to iOS Native Features.
* .m identifies Objective-C code. You can have Objective-C code, but no C++ code here.
* .mm, which identifies Objective-C++ code, which means you can write both Objective-C and C++ code: that's what allow us to have access to Native Features.

Your .mm file must be in the iOS folder, so that it's not included for Android or other platforms.
Add this code:

```cpp
#include "MailWrapper.h"
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
bool openUrl(std::string url)
{
    return [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:
     [NSURL URLWithString:[[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%s", url.c_str()] stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:
                           NSUTF8StringEncoding]]];
}
```

What we are doing here is:

* Convert the std::string into NSString*, assuming UTF-8 encoding
* Convert that NSString* into a NSURL*
* Open the URL using UIApplication (luckily for us, opening an url is very easy on iOS)
* Return the resulting BOOL (Objective-C for bool), which have the same representation as C++ bool (no cast needed)

This is a very simple feature which is included in the base iOS framework, UIKit. Often, you will need to add Frameworks to your Xcode project to call specific Native Features. For example, to use In-App purchases, you will need StoreKit.framework.

## Android Implementation
On Android, you can't easily mix C++ and Java like you can mix C++ and Objective-C on iOS.
You have to use JNI, which stands for Java Native Interface, which allows you to call Java code from C++ and the other way around.

First, let's do the Java code. In your proj.android/src folder, create a structure org/sample/wrappers and add a MailWrapper.java file here. 
The structure is important, because it allows JNI to find where your Java code is. Replace by your own. I advise you to keep your wrappers on a separate package than your main Activity Java code (and any other Java code you may have).

```java
package org.sample.wrappers
import android.content.ActivityNotFoundException;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.net.Uri;
public class MailWrapper 
{
	public static boolean openUrl(String url) 
    {
	     boolean result = true;
	     Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);  
	     i.setData(Uri.parse(url));
	     try
	     {
	         YourMainActivity.startActivity(i);
	     }
	     catch(ActivityNotFoundException e)
	     {
	         result = false;
	     }
	     return result;
    }
}
```

You need to replace `YourMainActivity` by your Activity which extends `Cocos2dxActivity`. The easiest way to do that is to make your main Activity a Singleton.

What we are doing here is:

* Building an Intent, to let another application handle the URL
* Set the URL as an Uri in the data of the Intent
* Start the Intent using the main activity
* Catch the Error if no application can handle the Intent


Now we need to do the C++ part to call that method. You may have noticed the method is static. That's because it's easier to call a static method than a non-static one. Otherwise, you need to instantiate an object first, call the method, and then free the object.

Create a .cpp file in your proj.android/jni folder. That's the place you should put all the C++ files calling Java code, as it is Android only. Don't forget to add the C++ file you just created in your Android.mk.

Add this C++ code in your .cpp file :

```cpp
#include "MailWrapper.h"
#include <jni.h>
#include "platform/android/jni/JniHelper.h"
#define  CLASS_NAME "org/sample/wrappers/MailWrapper"
bool openUrl(std::string url)
{
    JniMethodInfo minfo;
	CCAssert(JniHelper::getStaticMethodInfo(minfo, CLASS_NAME, "openUrl", "(Ljava/lang/String;)Z"), "Function doesn't exist");
	return minfo.env->CallStaticBooleanMethod(minfo.env->FindClass(CLASS_NAME), minfo.env->GetStaticMethodID(minfo.env->FindClass(CLASS_NAME), "openUrl", "(Ljava/lang/String;)Z"), minfo.env->NewStringUTF(url.c_str()));
}
```

Sounds complicated, isn't it? First, let's start with the define for `CLASS_NAME`. To be able to call Java code, JNI must know where it is, meaning the full package and the class name.

Then, using a Java environment (JniMethodInfo does a lot of work for you under the hood, like providing this environment), you call the static method. To identify a method, you need:

1. it's class, that the environment find for you, using the fully qualified class name
2. it's name, which must match the name in your Java code
3. it's prototype, using a JNI-specific syntax
4. the arguments you want to pass, which must be converted to JNI types

The first 2 points are straigthforward.
For the prototype, let's have a look at `(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`. You have, inside the parenthesis, the arguments. We only have one, a String, identified by `Ljava/lang/String;`: `L` identifies a Java Object, and must be followed by the fully qualified class name and a `;`. After the parenthesis, there is the return type, here `Z`, which identifies a bool.

You can add other arguments by putting them after, without any separator, for example `(FI)V` identifies a method taking a float and an int, which returns void (nothing).

Then, you must pass the arguments. For the basic types, you can mostly just cast them to their JNI types (for example, jboolean, jint, jfloat). For a String (or another Java Object) however, you need to create an instance. Luckily, the environment have a method to create a Java String from a const char*, called NewStringUTF.

## Other platforms
While waiting for the guide completion on other platforms, to make your code compile on them, you should add a .cpp file in the platform folder, with an empty declaration of openUrl:

```cpp
#include "MailWrapper.h"
bool openUrl(std::string url)
{
    return false;
}
```

## Conclusion
Making Native Wrappers isn't that easy, but allow you to access cool features. Luckily, the most used features (IAP, Social, Analytics) already have wrappers that you can use without doing that for each platform.
